Welcome to Searchle!

Searchle is a generic word search tool that can help with anything from crosswords to wordle

Use the pattern box to specify partial words using wildcard characters for unknown letters

You can use grouping or inverters instead of the wildcard characters for more specificity

You can use the require and avoid boxes to specify allowable letter counts


_______ Syntax _______
Wildcards: ? # * _ or .
Groupings: [Ls] or (Ls)
Inversion: ~L !L or ^L
String:    'Ls' or "Ls"
Number:    #L
Range:     #-#L or #+L
# means an integer
L means a letter
Ls means letters


Other Notes:

Capitalization, spaces, and commas, are ignored

Anywhere that you can use a letter, you can instead use a wildcard, group, inversion, or string

Groups are like wildcards, but they can only be from letters in the group

Inversions are like wildcards, but they can only be letters that don't match the following letter

Numbers or ranges can be used to specify a number of letters. Un-numbered letters are assumed to have a number of 1

Only the pattern box is order dependent while the require and avoid boxes can have letters in any order

Letters in the require box specify the allowable count of that letter in the final word. Unless specified as a range, the count is assumed to be at least the number given

Letters in the avoid box specify that the allowable count is less than the number given

You can simply use a number or range in the pattern tool instead of a full pattern

Strings are like letters, but longer

You can actually pass regular expressions directly using a string noting that edges will be bound
