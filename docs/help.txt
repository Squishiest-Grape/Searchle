_ Welcome to Searchle! _
- Searchle is a generic word search tool that can help with anything from crosswords to wordle
- Use the pattern box to specify partial words using wildcard characters for unknown letters
- You can use grouping or inverters instead of the wildcard characters for more specificity
- You can use the require and avoid boxes to specify allowable letter counts

_______ Syntax _______
Wildcards: ? # * _ or .
Groupings: [Ls] or (Ls)
Inverters: ~L !L or ^L
String:    'Ls' or "Ls"
Number:    #L
Range:     #-#L or #+L
# means an integer
L means a letter
Ls means letters

________ Notes ________
- Anywhere that you can use a letter, you can instead use a wildcard, group, inversion, or string
- Groups are like wildcards, but they can only be from letters in the group
- Inversions are like wildcards, but they can only be letters that don't match the following letter
- Numbers or ranges can be used to specify a number of letters. Un-numbered letters are assumed to have a number of 1
- Letters in the require box specify the allowable count of that letter in the final word. Unless specified as a range, the count is assumed to be at least the number given
- Letters in the avoid box specify that the allowable count is less than the number given
- Strings are like letters, but longer
- Spaces, commas, and capitalization is ignored except in strings
