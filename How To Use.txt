You can seach for words using wildcard characters ?#*_. (they all do the same thing)
    Pattern:  fish_ng 
    Result:   fishing
    Pattern:  ??ion 
    Result:   onion Orion

You can also use numbers as either values or ranges
    Pattern:  5-6?
    Result:   All 5 to 6 letter words 
    Pattern:  5+
    Result:   All words with 5 or more letters (the trailing wildcard can be omitted)
  
You can place global wildcard limits through the requires, avoids, and allows
    Pattern:  10
    Requires: aa3-4c1d
    Avoids:   b
    Result:   10 letter words with at least 2 'a's, 3 to 4 'c's, at least 1 'd', and no 'b's
      
You can place local wildcard limits with groupings [] or () (they both do the same thing)
    Pattern:  ??(aeiou)??  
    Result:   5 letter words with a vowel in the middle
    
You can also negate letters or groupings with characters !~^ in front (they all do the same thing)
    Pattern:  HE_!LO
    Result:   helio
    
You can add substrings with '' or ""
    Pattern:  5
    Requires: 'ion'
    Result:   5 letter words that have 'ion' inside them
    
You can use regexp using substrings and .* to disconnect the bound edges
    Pattern:  '.*cat.*'
    Result:   Any word with cat anywhere in it
