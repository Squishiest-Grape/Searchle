You can seach for words using wildcard characters. Use '?' or '#' or '*' or '_' or '.'
    Pattern:  **ion 
    Result:   union onion Orion scion anion prion Arion axion Ixion inion adion stion

You can use numbers in front to indicate ranges of acceptable values. Use #, #-#, #+
    Pattern:  5-6  (the trailing wildcard can be omitted)
    Result:   All 5 to 6 letter words
  
You can place global wildcard limits through the requires, avoids, and allows. 
    Pattern:  10
    Requires: aa3-4c1d    
    Avoids:   b
    Result:   10 letter words with at least 2 'a's, 3 to 4 'c's, at least 1 'd', and no 'b's
      
You can place local wildcard limits with groupings. Use '[]' or '()'
    Pattern:  ??(aeiou)??  
    Result:   5 letter words with a vowel in the middle
    
You can use negate opperators in front. Use '!' or '~' or '^'
    Pattern:  HE!2LO
    Result:   Word with pattern he??o, but no 'L' in the 3rd or 4th spot -> hermo
    
You can search/require substrings with '' or ""
    Pattern:  5
    Requires: 'ion'
    Result:   5 letter words that have 'ion' inside them



Requires, Avoids, and Allows are just different ways of specifying the allowable ranges for each letter's counts (excluding those specified)
    Requires:
    - Providing no number forces that value's count to be in the range [1,inf]
    - Providing a singular number forces that value's count to be in the range [#,inf]
    - Multiple singular number inputs of the same letter sum their bounds, while ranges inputs overide
    - A letter's range must satisfy both Avoids and Allows unless overwriten by a Requires
    Avoids:
    - Providing no number forces that value's count to be in the range [0,0]
    - Providing a singular number forces that value's count to be in the range [0,#]
    Allows:
    - If Allows is empty, all letter's count are set to the range [0,inf]
    - If Allows in not empty, all unlisted letters are assumed to have the range [0,0]
    - Providing no number forces that value's count to be in the range [0,inf] 
    - Providing a singular number forces that values count to be in the range [0,#]
